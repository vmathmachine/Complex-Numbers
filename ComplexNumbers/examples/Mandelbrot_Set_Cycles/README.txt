This idea was inspired by Numberphile's video "What's so special about the Mandelbrot Set? - Numberphile", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk.  In it, Ben Sparks shows a program he developed which shows details on the Mandelbrot set.  This program is essentially just a replica of his program, done to the best of my abilities.  If you haven't seen their video, by the way, I recommend you check it out.  They do a far better job at explaining this than I ever could.  That said, I will now attempt to explain it:

The Mandelbrot set is the set of all complex numbers z such that, if you repeatedly square then add z, you will never diverge off to infinity.  In his program, he hovers his mouse over a particular point z, and the computer shows z, z²+z, (z²+z)²+z, ((z²+z)²+z)²+z, etc.  This allows us to see the behavior of each point as this transformation is repeatedly applied.  In the main cardioid in the center, for example, the end result is convergence on a single point.  In the circle to the left of it, we cycle back and forth between 2 points.  On the circle to the left of that, we cycle between 4 numbers, and on the circles above and below the main cardioid, we cycle between 3 numbers.  (Though technically, the circles above and below the cardioid aren't perfect circles).  If the point isn't on the set, the series will diverge to infinity.  If the point is just barely not on the set, the series may take a while to diverge.  This program does a good job at simulating the patterns that emerge from the Mandelbrot set.

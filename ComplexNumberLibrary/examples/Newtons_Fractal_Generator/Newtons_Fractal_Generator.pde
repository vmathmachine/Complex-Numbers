    /** NOTE:
     * Since we don't have the luxury of utilizing the GPU to perform parallel processing, we instead have to perform all our calculations on the CPU.  This isn't ideal, as it means we have to calculate Newton's method
     * on 360,000 complex numbers every single frame.  Even a lot of modern CPUs just aren't built for that kind of heavy lifting, so instead, I've implemented what's known as "interlacing".  Instead of doing this for every
     * single pixel every single frame, I do it for 1/16th of the pixels every frame, and each frame it's a different 16th.  To be more specific, we do it for every 4 pixels in the x and y direction, starting from a different
     * location every time.  Unfortunately, this tends to cause some unseemly issues when the picture on the screen is constantly changing.  Most programs that utilize it only split it up into halves, and even they seem a
     * bit off, so you can imagine how bad it must be when splitting into 16ths.
     *
     * Luckily, we only do this when the picture is static and unchanging.  Whenever we move the picture around, zoom in or out, or move around one of the roots, we instead lower the quality.  Instead of continually drawing
     * another 1/16th of the pixels over the course of 16 frames, we just calculate the colors of 1/16th of the pixels, then paint the surrounding 4x4 square that exact color.  The resulting image comes out as blurry, but luckily,
     * I actually don't care!  It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make, and it looks better than trying to interlace a moving picture.  And it's also better than trying to drag around the image and the program responding so slowly
     * you actually can't tell if your movements are being read.  This blurry image is generated anytime refresh is enabled.  If the picture isn't moving or changing in any way, refresh will be disabled, we can draw over and fine
     * tune the blurry image.  THIS IS ACTUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF DRAWING A BLURRY IMAGE, so we can fine tune it once refresh is false.  And it won't look that much different, or at the very least it won't be jarringly
     * different, and we can still sort of tell what it's supposed to look like before it's even done rendering.  Admittedly, this aspect can be amplified by carefully choosing the order that each 1/16 of the pixels is chosen,
     * but I didn't really feel like doing that, so I didn't.

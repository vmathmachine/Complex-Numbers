/**
 * An additional class for more complicated, special functions.
 * 
 * <br> Such functions currently include the Gamma function, as well as several related functions such as the factorial and the digamma
 * function.
 * 
 * <br> In later versions, I plan on implementing functions related to the error function, the Riemmann Zeta function, the exponential
 * integral, polylogarithms, and elliptic integrals.  All of said functions have been built, but they have yet to be rigorously tested.
 * Also, the Elliptic integral of the third kind is extremely in the beta stages, as while I know how to compute it, I haven't the foggiest
 * idea how to remove any of its branch cuts.
 * 
 * <br> I also have plans to implement the Bessel functions, the incomplete gamma function, the Hurwitz zeta function, the Lambert W function
 * (also known as the product logarithm).  However, none of said functions have been built.
